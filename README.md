# Covid19-SQL-and-Tableau-Visualization-. Here is my Tableau Link https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/amarildo6571/viz/CovidDashboard_16509967528430/Dashboard1. 
In this project we will be looking into Covid19 and the dataset its real and will be in the link right here @https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths. We are going to see what is the total number of deaths, number of infected and death %. We will see which continent is the most infected with Covid19 in a bar chart as well as in a map design. We will also look at the % of population infected and a future forecast of that %. Most of the work was done in SQL to create our own tables and what we wanted to get out of the dataset and then did the visualization in Tableau which looks something like this <img width="806" alt="Tableau Covid" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93358935/166609962-43825900-5b90-458d-8781-b6431d3da7b5.png">.
